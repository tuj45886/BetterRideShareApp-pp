# BetterRideShareApp-pp
## Abstract
The app uses RESTful API’s from Lyft and Uber to create a better, more customizable ride share experience. It provides users with comparisons for ride prices and estimated pick up times between the two aforementioned ride share apps, giving them the ability to select a quicker ride if they are in a hurry or a cheaper one if they so choose. Ride requests can be made in the app as it is not just a tool for comparisons. Safety features like creating a blocked list that you can share amongst your friends to ensure that neither you nor they ever get a driver on that list can also become a part of The Better Ride Share App. 

## Technical Requirements
As for the technical aspects of the program, it is heavily dependent on already existing Application Programming Interfaces (API’s). This allows us to interact with Uber and Lyft’s existing services. From Lyft, we will take advantage of GetCost(), GetDrivers, GetETA() methods. Similar methods from Uber will implemented as well. These will give us the values to compare locally and use as data to create the aforementioned functionalities. In addition to this, the project will be written in JavaScript. This is a requirement of React Native. React Native is an open source framework that can create multiple native apps from a single JavaScript code base. In the case of this program, we will be interested  in Android and Swift codebases created by react.

## Project Relevance
The project is very large and will practically apply in one way or another all Educational Goals required. Including but not limited to an objected oriented design, a graphic user interface and access to a database. All version control on this project will be done using GitHub. Testing will be an integral part of the project development
