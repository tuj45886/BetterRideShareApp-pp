## BetterRideShareApp-pp
The app uses RESTful API’s from Lyft and Uber to create a better, more customizable ride share experience. It provides users with comparisons for ride prices and estimated pick up times between the two aforementioned ride share apps, giving them the ability to select a quicker ride if they are in a hurry or a cheaper one if they so choose. Ride requests can be made in the app as it is not just a tool for comparisons. Safety features like creating a blocked list that you can share amongst your friends to ensure that neither you nor they ever get a driver on that list can also become a part of The Better Ride Share App.
